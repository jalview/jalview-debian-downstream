Jalview Readme
--------------


The source is available as a tar file and comes complete with the GNU General Public License. 

To build the application you will need a J2SDK 1.6+. 

An Ant build file (build.xml) is provided, you will need to install Apache Ant first. 
Run ant to view usage which will display a list of useful build targets.

Jalview is primarily developed with eclipse, and a .project file is provided to simplify importing the source into your own eclipse workspace. A NetBeans nbbuild.xml file is also provided for developing Jalview with NetBeans - but this is not officially supported.

You may also be able to use Borland JBuilder to build Jalview. A JBuilder project file 
(JalviewX.jpx, JalviewApplet.jpx) for both application and applet is provided, 
but the library dependencies are almost certainly out of date. See the build.xml 
for current dependencies.
