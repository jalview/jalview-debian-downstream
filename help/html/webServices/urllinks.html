<head>Opening URLs from Jalview
</head>
<body>
  <p>
  <p>
    <strong>Opening URLs from Jalview</strong><br> Both the applet
    and the desktop application are able to open URLs as 'popups' in
    your web browser. <br> Double-clicking on the ID of a sequence
    will open the first URL that can be generated from its sequence ID.
    This is by default the EMBL-EBI site, but you can easily configure your own <a
      href="#urllinks">sequence URL links</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Other links for a sequence either derived from any other configured
    URL links, or imported from the sequence's annotation, are accessed
    by right clicking to open the sequence pop-up menu, and selecting
    from the <em>Links</em> submenu.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong><a name="urllinks">Configuring URL Links</a></strong> <br>URL
    links are defined in the &quot;Connections&quot; tab of the <a
    href="../features/preferences.html">Jalview desktop
    preferences</a>, or specified as <a
    href="http://www.jalview.org/examples/appletParameters.html#parameters">applet
    parameters</a>. <br> By default the item &quot;EMBL-EBI Search&quot; is added
    to this link menu. This link will show a web page in your default
    browser with the selected sequence id as part of the URL.<br>
    In the preferences dialog box, click <strong>new</strong> to add a
    new link, and <strong>edit</strong> to modify an existing link, or <strong>delete</strong>
    to remove it.<br> You can name the link, this will be displayed
    on a new menu item under the &quot;Link&quot; menu when you right
    click on a sequence id. <br> The URL string must contain a
    token that can be replaced with a sequence ID or DB accession ID. The simplest token is
    &quot;$SEQUENCE_ID$&quot;, which will be replaced by the chosen
    sequence id when you click on it. 
  </p>
  <p>
    eg.<br> UniRef100 =
    http://www.ebi.uniprot.org/uniprot-srv/uniRefView.do?proteinAc=$SEQUENCE_ID$&amp;library=uniref100<br>
    Swissprot = http://www.expasy.org/uniprot/$SEQUENCE_ID$ <br> <br>
    Links will also be made for any database cross references associated
    with the sequence where the database name exactly matches a URL link
    name. In this case, the $DB_ACCESSION$ string will be replaced with
    the accession string for the database cross-reference, rather than
    the sequence ID for the sequence (<em>since Jalview 2.10.1</em>).
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong><a name="warning">Warning dialog about updating
        your configured URL links</a></strong><br /> In the desktop
    prior to Jalview 2.10.1, the only way to configure custom links for
    a particular database cross-reference for a sequence was to give it
    a name that
    <em>exactly</em> matched the database source, and a regular
    expression for filtering out any spurious matches generated when the
    custom linked was tested against the Sequence's ID string. Since the
    introduction of the $DB_ACCESSION$ token, however, $SEQUENCE_ID$
    will not be used for database cross-reference accession strings, and
    if you have custom links configured, Jalview will raise a warning
    message so let you know that you may need to update your links to
    use $DB_ACCESSION$.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Regular Expression Substitution</strong><br> A url may
    contain a string of the form $SEQUENCE_ID=/<em>regular
    expression</em>/=$ or $DB_ACCESSION=/<em>regular expression</em>/=$. 
    In this case, the regular expression will be
    applied to the full sequence ID or DB accession ID string and the resulting match will
    be inserted into the URL. Groups of parentheses can be used to
    specify which regions of the regular expression will be used to
    generate the URL:
  <ul>
    <li>Each top level parenthesis will yield a URL containing the
      text matched within that parenthesis.</li>
    <li>Regions matching sub-parentheses within a top-level
      parenthesis will be concatenated to form the text inserted into
      the URL for the top-level parenthesis.</li>
    <em>Please Note:
      <ul>
        <li>The regular expressions supported by Jalview are those
          provided by the <a href="http://www.javaregex.com">Stevesoft
            javaregex package</a>.
        </li>
        <li>Some characters must be escaped when specifying them as
          a match within a regular expression.</li>
      </ul> <br> Many Thanks to Bernd Brandt of the Free University of
      Amsterdam for testing this new regular-expression expansion
      feature!
