		<strong>The Jalview Desktop RSS News Reader</strong><br /> The
		Jalview Desktop includes a built in news reader for the <a
			href="http://www.jalview.org/feeds/desktop/rss">Jalview Desktop
			News Channel</a>.
	</p>

	<p>We will use the desktop news channel to keep you informed of
		important updates relevant to users of the Jalview desktop, such as
		web service outages and user community events.</p>
	<p>The news reader will be launched automatically when you start
		the Desktop if new items are available. Should you want to browse
		older items, however, you can open it manually from the 'Jalview news
		reader' option in the Desktop's 'Tools' menu.</p>
