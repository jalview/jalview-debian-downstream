<p><strong>Annotation Panel Menus</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li> <strong>Annotation Label Popup Menu</strong><br>
    <em>This menu is opened by clicking anywhere on the annotation row labels 
    area (below the sequence ID area).</em> 
    <ul>
      <li><strong> Add New Row</strong><br>
        <em>Adds a new, named annotation row (a dialog box will pop up for you 
        to enter the label for the new row). </em> </li>
      <li><strong>Hide Row</strong><br>
        <em>Hides the annotation row whose label was clicked in order to bring 
        up the menu.</em> </li>
      <li><strong>Delete Row</strong><br>
        <em>Deletes the annotation row whose label was clicked in order to bring 
        up the menu.</em> </li>
      <li><strong>Show All Hidden Rows</strong><br>
        <em>Shows all hidden annotation rows.</em> </li>
      <li><strong>Export Annotation</strong> <em>(Application only)</em><br>
       <em>Annotations can be saved to file or output to a text window in either the 
        Jalview annotations format or as a spreadsheet style set of comma separated values (CSV). </em> </li>
      <li><strong>Show Values in Text Box</strong> <em>(applet only)</em><br>
        <em>Opens a text box with a list of comma-separated values corresponding 
        to the annotation (numerical or otherwise) at each position in the row. 
        This is useful to export alignment quality measurements for further analysis.</em> 
      </li>
   </ul>
   <em>The following additional entries are avalable when the popup menu is opened on a consensus sequence annotation row:</em> 
   <ul>
      <li><strong>Ignore Gaps in Consensus</strong><br>
        If this checkbox is selected, all consensus calculations performed in 
        the current Alignment window will be done without counting gaps as a consensus 
        character.</li>
      <li><strong>Copy Consensus Sequence</strong><br>
        Copies the consensus sequence to the clipboard in Fasta format, to allow 
        the consensus sequence to be added to an alignment. Note the copied sequence 
        is not accessible to other programs if Jalview is running as an applet 
        in a web page.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Annotation Popup Menu<br>
    </strong><em>This menu is opened when right-clicking on the selected positions 
    of an annotation.</em> 
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Helix</strong><br>
        <em>Mark selected positions with a helix glyph (a red oval), and optional 
        text label (see below). Consecutive ovals will be rendered as an unbroken 
        red line.</em> </li>
      <li><strong>Sheet</strong><br>
        <em>Mark selected positions with a sheet glyph (a green arrow oriented 
        from left to right), and optional text label (see below). Consecutive 
        arrows will be joined together to form a single green arrow.</em> </li>
      <li><strong>Label</strong><br>
        <em>Sets the text label at the selected positions. If more that one consecutive 
        position is marked with the same label, only the first position's label 
        will be rendered.</em> </li>
      <li><strong>Colour</strong><br>
        <em>Changes the colour of the annotation text label.</em> </li>
      <li><strong>Remove Annotation</strong><br>
        <em>Blanks any annotation at the selected positions on the row. Note: 
        <strong>This cannot be undone</strong></em> </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
