		<p><strong>Web Service Menu</strong><br /> <em>This menu
				is dynamic, and may contain user-defined web service entries in
				addition to any of the following ones:</em>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Fetch DB References</strong><br> <em>This
						will use any of the database services that Jalview is aware of
						(e.g. DAS sequence servers and the WSDBFetch service provided by
						the EBI) to verify the sequence and retrieve all database cross
						references and PDB ids associated with all or just the selected
						sequences in the alignment. <br />'Standard Databases' will check
						sequences against the EBI databases plus any active DAS sequence
						sources, or you can verify against a specific source from one of
						the sub-menus.</em><br></li>
				<li><strong>Envision2 Services</strong><br /><em> Submits one or
					more sequences, sequence IDs or database references to analysis
					workflows provided by the <a
					href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/enfin-srv/envision2">EnVision2 web
						application</a>. This allows Jalview users to easily access the EnCore
					network of databases and analysis services developed by members of
					<a href="http://www.enfin.org">ENFIN</a></em>.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Selecting items from the following submenus will start a
				remote service on compute facilities at the University of Dundee, or
				elsewhere. You need a continuous network connection in order to use
				these services through Jalview.
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Alignment</strong><br /><em> Align the currently
					selected sequences or all sequences in the alignment, or re-align
					unaligned sequences to the aligned sequences. Entries in this menu
					provide access to the various alignment programs supported by <a
					href="../webServices/JABAWS.html">JABAWS</a>. See the <a
					href="../webServices/msaclient.html">Multiple Sequence
						Alignment webservice client</a> entry for more information.</em></li>
				<li><strong>Secondary Structure Prediction</strong>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>JPred Secondary Structure Prediction</strong><br>
							<em>Secondary structure prediction by network consensus. See
								the <a href="../webServices/jnet.html">Jpred3</a> client entry for
								more information. The behaviour of this calculation depends on
								the current selection:
								<ul>
									<li>If nothing is selected, and the displayed sequences
										appear to be aligned, then a JNet prediction will be run for
										the first sequence in the alignment, using the current
										alignment. Otherwise the first sequence will be submitted for
										prediction.</li>
									<li>If just one sequence (or a region on one sequence) has
										been selected, it will be submitted to the automatic JNet
										prediction server for homolog detection and prediction.</li>
									<li>If a set of sequences are selected, and they appear to
										be aligned, then the alignment will be used for a Jnet
										prediction on the <strong>first</strong> sequence in the set
										(that is, the one that appears first in the alignment window).
									</li>
								</ul> </em>
					</ul></li>
				<li><strong>Analysis</strong><br />
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Multi-Harmony</strong><br> <em>Performs
								functional residue analysis on a protein family alignment with
								sub-families defined on it. See the <a
								href="../webServices/shmr.html">Multi-Harmony service</a> entry for more
								information.</em>
						</li>
