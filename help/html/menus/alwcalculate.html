	<ul>
		<li><strong>Sort </strong>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>by ID</strong><em><br> This will sort the
						sequences according to sequence name. If the sort is repeated, the
						order of the sorted sequences will be inverted. </em>
				</li>
				<li><strong>by Length</strong><em><br> This will sort
						the sequences according to their length (excluding gap
						characters). If the sort is repeated, the order of the sorted
						sequences will be inverted. </em>
				</li>
				<li><strong>by Group</strong><strong><br> </strong><em>This
						will sort the sequences according to sequence name. If the sort is
						repeated, the order of the sorted sequences will be inverted. </em><strong></strong>
				</li>
				<li><strong>by Pairwise Identity<br> </strong><em>This
						will sort the selected sequences by their percentage identity to
						the consensus sequence. The most similar sequence is put at the
						top. </em>
				</li>
				<li><em>The <a href="../calculations/sorting.html">Sort
							menu</a> will have some additional options if the alignment has any
						associated score annotation, or you have just done a multiple
						alignment calculation or opened a tree viewer window.</em><br></li>
			</ul></li>
		<li><strong>Calculate Tree </strong> <br> <em>Functions
				for calculating trees on the alignment or the currently selected
				region. See <a href="../calculations/tree.html">calculating
					trees</a>.</em>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Average Distance Using % Identity</strong>
				</li>
				<li><strong>Neighbour Joining Using % Identity</strong>
				</li>
				<li><strong>Average Distance Using Blosum62</strong>
				</li>
				<li><strong>Neighbour Joining Using Blosum62<br>
				</strong>
				</li>
			</ul></li>
		<li><strong>Pairwise Alignments</strong><br> <em>Applies
				Smith and Waterman algorithm to selected sequences. See <a
				href="../calculations/pairwise.html">pairwise alignments</a>.</em><br>
		</li>
		<li><strong>Principal Component Analysis</strong><br> <em>Shows
				a spatial clustering of the sequences based on the BLOSUM62 scores
				in the alignment. See <a href="../calculations/pca.html">Principal
					Component Analysis</a>.</em> <br></li>
		<li><strong>Extract Scores ... (optional)</strong><br> <em>This
				option is only visible if Jalview detects one or more white-space
				separated values in the description line of the alignment sequences.<br>
				When selected, these numbers are parsed into sequence associated
				annotation which can then be used to sort the alignment via the Sort
				by&#8594;Score menu.</em> <br></li>

		<li><strong>Autocalculate Consensus</strong><br> <em>For
				large alignments it can be useful to deselect &quot;Autocalculate
				Consensus&quot; when editing. This prevents the sometimes lengthy
				calculations performed after each sequence edit.</em> <br></li>
		<li><strong>Sort Alignment With New Tree</strong><br> <em>If
				this option is selected, the alignment will be automatically sorted
				whenever a new tree is calculated or loaded.</em> <br>
		</li>
