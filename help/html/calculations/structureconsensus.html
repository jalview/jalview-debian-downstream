    <strong>Alignment RNA Structure Consensus Annotation</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    The RNA structure consensus displayed below the alignment is the
    percentage of valid base pairs per column. It is calculated in
    relation to a secondary structure and just paired columns are
    calculated. The canonical Watson-Crick base pairings (A-T/U, G-C)
    and the wobble base pair (G-T/U) are regarded as valid pairings.<br>
    The amount of valid base pairs is indicated by the profile in the
    Alignment Annotation row.<br> By default this calculation
    includes gaps in columns. You can choose to ignore gaps in the
    calculation by right clicking on the label &quot;StrConsensus&quot;
    to the left of the structure consensus bar chart.<br>
  <p>
    <strong>Structure logo</strong>
  </p>
  By clicking on the label you can also activate the structure logo. It
  is very similar to a sequence logo but counts the numbers of base
  pairs. There are two residues per column, the actual column and the
  interacting base. The opening bracket is always the one on the left
  side.
  <br> Like sequence logos the relative amount of a specific base
  pair can be estimated by its size in the logo. The tool tip of a
  column gives the exact numbers for all occurring valid base pairs.
