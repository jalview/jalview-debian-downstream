  <p>
    <strong>Reference Sequence Alignment Views</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    The reference sequence for an alignment is indicated by its ID being
    shown in bold. When a reference sequence has been defined, the <strong>Format&#8594;Show
      unconserved</strong> option highlights mutations with respect to the
    reference sequence, rather than the alignment's consensus sequence.
  </p>
  <p>
  <ul>
    <li>Jalview automatically assigns a reference sequence when <a
      href="../webServices/jnet.html"
    >JPred4</a> predictions are imported.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Assigning a reference sequence</strong><br /> A
      sequence can be marked as the reference sequence by right-clicking
      on it's ID to open the popup menu, and selecting the "<strong>(Sequence
        ID)&#8594;Mark as Reference</strong>" entry."</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    <em>Reference sequence based alignment visualisation was
      introduced in Jalview 2.9.</em>
