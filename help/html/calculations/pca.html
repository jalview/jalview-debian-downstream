    <strong>Principal Component Analysis</strong>
  </p>
  <p>This calculation creates a spatial representation of the
    similarities within a selected group, or all of the sequences in an
    alignment. After the calculation finishes, a 3D viewer displays the
    set of sequences as points in 'similarity space', and similar
    sequences tend to lie near each other in the space.</p>
  <p>
    <em>Caveats</em><br />The calculation is computationally expensive,
    and may fail for very large sets of sequences - usually because the
    JVM has run out of memory. A future release of Jalview will be able
    to avoid this by executing the calculation via a web service.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>About PCA</strong>
  </p>
  <p>Principal components analysis is a technique for examining the
    structure of complex data sets. The components are a set of
    dimensions formed from the measured values in the data set, and the
    principal component is the one with the greatest magnitude, or
    length. The sets of measurements that differ the most should lie at
    either end of this principal axis, and the other axes correspond to
    less extreme patterns of variation in the data set.</p>

  <p>
    <em>Calculating PCAs for aligned sequences</em><br />Jalview can
    perform PCA analysis on both proteins and nucleotide sequence
    alignments. In both cases, components are generated by an
    eigenvector decomposition of the matrix formed from the sum of
    substitution matrix scores at each aligned position between each
    pair of sequences - computed with one of the available score
    matrices, such as <a href="scorematrices.html#blosum62">BLOSUM62</a>,
    <a href="scorematrices.html#pam250">PAM250</a>, or the <a
      href="scorematrices.html#simplenucleotide"
    >simple single nucleotide substitution matrix</a>. The options
    available for calculation are given in the <strong><em>Change
        Parameters</em></strong> menu.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>PCA Calculation modes</em><br /> The default Jalview calculation
    mode (indicated when <em><strong>Jalview PCA
        Calculation</strong></em> is ticked in the <strong><em>Change
        Parameters</em></strong> menu) is to perform a PCA on a matrix where elements
    in the upper diagonal give the sum of scores for mutating in one
    direction, and the lower diagonal is the sum of scores for mutating
    in the other. For protein substitution models like BLOSUM62, this
    gives an asymmetric matrix, and a different PCA to a matrix produced
    with the method described in the paper by G. Casari, C. Sander and
    A. Valencia. Structural Biology volume 2, no. 2, February 1995 (<a
      href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=pubmed&dopt=Abstract&list_uids=7749921"
    >pubmed</a>) and implemented at the SeqSpace server at the EBI. This
    method preconditions the matrix by multiplying it with its
    transpose, and can be employed in the PCA viewer by unchecking the <strong><em>Jalview
        PCA Calculation</em></strong> option in the <strong><em>Change
        Parameters</em></strong> menu.

    <strong>The PCA Viewer</strong>
  </p>
  <p>This is an interactive display of the sequences positioned
    within the similarity space, as points in a rotateable 3D
    scatterplot. The colour of each sequence point is the same as the
    sequence group colours, white if no colour has been defined for the
    sequence, and green if the sequence is part of a the currently
    selected group.</p>
  <p>
    The 3d view can be rotated by dragging the mouse with the <strong>left
      mouse button</strong> pressed. The view can also be zoomed in and out with
    the up and down <strong>arrow keys</strong> (and the roll bar of the
    mouse if present). Labels will be shown for each sequence if the
    entry in the View menu is checked, and the plot background colour
    changed from the View&#8594;Background Colour.. dialog box. The File
    menu allows the view to be saved (<strong>File&#8594;Save</strong>
    submenu) as an EPS or PNG image or printed, and the original
    alignment data and matrix resulting from its PCA analysis to be
    retrieved. The coordinates for the whole PCA space, or just the
    current view may also be exported as CSV files for visualization in
    another program or further analysis.
  <p>
  <p>Options for coordinates export are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Output Values - complete dump of analysis (TxT* matrix
      computed from sum of scores for all pairs of aligned residues from
      from i->j and j->i, conditioned matrix to be diagonalised,
      tridiagonal form, major eigenvalues found)</li>
    <li>Output Points - The eigenvector matrix - rows correspond to
      sequences, columns correspond to each dimension in the PCA</li>
    <li>Transformed Points - The 3D coordinates for each sequence
      as shown in the PCA plot</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    A tool tip gives the sequence ID corresponding to a point in the
    space, and clicking a point toggles the selection of the
    corresponding sequence in the associated alignment window views.
    <!-- Rectangular region
based selection is also possible, by holding the 'S' key whilst
left-clicking and dragging the mouse over the display. -->
    By default, points are only associated with the alignment view from
    which the PCA was calculated, but this may be changed via the <strong>View&#8594;Associate
      Nodes</strong> sub-menu.
  </p>
  <p>
    Initially, the display shows the first three components of the
    similarity space, but any eigenvector can be used by changing the
    selected dimension for the x, y, or z axis through each ones menu
    located below the 3d display. The <strong><em>Reset</em></strong>
    button will reset axis and rotation settings to their defaults.
  </p>
  <p>
  <p>
    <em>The output of points and transformed point coordinates was
      added to the Jalview desktop in v2.7.</em> <em>The Reset button
      and Change Parameters menu were added in Jalview 2.8.</em> <em>Support
      for PAM250 based PCA was added in Jalview 2.8.1.</em>
