Jalview (2009) is a fast Java multiple alignment editor and analysis tool. It
features many of the functions of <a href="http://www.compbio.dundee.ac.uk/Software/Amas/amas.html">AMAS</a>,
for the analysis of sub-families and the prediction of functional sites, but is
fully interactive. (View the <a href="http://www.jalview.org">Jalview homepage</a> at www.jalview.org).
