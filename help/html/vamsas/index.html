<title>VAMSAS Interoperation</title>
</head>
<body>
<p><strong>VAMSAS Interoperation</strong></p>
<p>Jalview can interact with other applications using &quot;the <strong>VAMSAS
Interoperation framework</strong>&quot; which is an experimental model for
interoperation between bioinformatics applications (<strong>V</strong>isualization
and <strong>A</strong>nalysis of <strong>Molecular</strong> <strong>S</strong>equences,
<strong>Alignements</strong> and <strong>S</strong>tructures).
Currently, the only other VAMSAS enabled application is <a
	href="http://www.topali.org">TOPALi</a> - a user friendly program for
phylogenetics and evolutionary analysis.
<p>VAMSAS enabled applications access a shared bioinformatics
dataset containing sequences, alignments, annotation and trees, which
can be represented by an XML document analogous to a <a
	href="../features/jalarchive.html">Jalview Project Archive</a>.</p>
<br>
<strong>Connecting to a VAMSAS session</strong><br>
The VAMSAS functionality in Jalview is accessed through the Desktop's <strong>Vamsas</strong>
menu. The options available in this menu depend on whether the
application is currently interacting with a VAMSAS dataset in a <strong>VAMSAS
session</strong>. When the application is not connected to a session is active,
the menu options are as follows:<br>
<ul>
	<li><em>Connect to an existing session</em><br>
	If visible, this submenu contains a list of existing sessions that the
	VAMSAS framework has discovered on your computer. <br>
	Choose one to connect to it.</li>
	<li><em>New VAMSAS Session</em><br>
	This option will create a new session on your computer.</li>
	<li><em>Load VAMSAS Session...</em><br>
	This option will open a file browser window allowing you to select a
	VAMSAS session archive from which a new session will be created.<br/>
	<em>New in 2.5:</em>Sessions created from an imported document inherit
	the file or URL for the document.</li>

</ul>
<br>
<strong>VAMSAS and Firewalls</strong>: VAMSAS uses sockets to
communicate between different programs. This means that after starting a
session, your firewall software may ask you whether to allow the java
executable access to the internet (port 53782). If you do not allow
this, messages will not be exchanged with other VAMSAS applications.</br>
<br>
Once you have successfully connected to a VAMSAS session, any data made
available by other VAMSAS applications will be automatically imported
into Jalview. However, in order to share the data in Jalview with other
VAMSAS applications, you must manually select the <strong>Vamsas&#8594;&quot;Session
Update&quot;</strong> entry that is visible when a session is active. Selecting
this option will update the VAMSAS session document, with the data
loaded into Jalview. Any new alignments, trees and annotation will be
written to the session, in addition to any edits you have made to data
originally stored in the document. <br>
<strong>Saving the current session</strong><br>
You can save the current session as a VAMSAS Session archive using the <strong>Vamsas&#8594;&quot;Session
Update&quot;</strong>. The file contains a snapshot of the current VAMSAS
session, including data from any other applications connected to the
session. <strong>Leaving a VAMSAS session</strong><br>
A session can be disconnected from at any time using the <strong>Vamsas&#8594;&quot;Stop
Session&quot;</strong> option. Selecting this option will only disconnect Jalview
from the session - any other applications will remain connected to the
session. If Jalview is the only application connected to the session and
you have not yet saved the VAMSAS session then you will be prompted with
an optional 'Save VAMSAS session...' dialog box, allowing the session to
be saved and returned to at a later date. <br>
<strong>VAMSAS Session Persistence</strong><br>
VAMSAS sessions are persistent - this means that they exist
independently of any VAMSAS applications that are connected to them.
This means that if something goes wrong with a VAMSAS application and it
crashes or otherwise fails, the VAMSAS session it is connected to will
(hopefully) be unaffected. For instance, if Jalview is killed or crashes
whilst it is still connected to a session, that session can be recovered
in a new Jalview instance using the <strong>Vamsas&#8594;&quot;Existing
session&quot;</strong> sub menu.</p>
<strong>A quick Demo</strong>
<br>
Jalview can talk to itself through VAMSAS. Simply start two copies of
the application, create a new vamsas session in one, and connect to the
new session in the other. Then load your data into one of the
applications, and use the
<strong>Vamsas&#8594;&quot;Session Update&quot;</strong>
menu entry to try to propagate the data to the other application.

<p>Version 0.2 of the VAMSAS client library is used in <em>Jalview
2.5</em>. For further details about the VAMSAS framework, please check the
<a href="http://www.vamsas.ac.uk">VAMSAS website</a>. The VAMSAS
framework is implemented as a Java 1.4 Library and depends on a number
of other open source projects. Its source is released under the
