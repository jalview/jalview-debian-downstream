<body>
<p><strong> Annotation Colouring </strong></p>
<p>Jalview allows the columns of an alignment to be coloured using any 
  numerical annotation rows added to that alignment. </p>
Select &quot;Colour&quot; <strong>&#8594;</strong> &quot;.. 
  by Annotation&quot; to bring up the Colour by Annotation settings window. <br>
  <br><div align="center">
  <img src="annotationColourSetting.jpg" width="507" height="202"> </div>
<ul>
  <li>Select which annotation to base the colouring scheme on using the top left 
    selection box.</li>
  <li> If the &quot;Use Original Colours&quot; box is selected, the colouring 
    scheme will use the colouring scheme present on the alignment before the Annotation 
    Colour Settings window was displayed. </li>
		<li>The colour scheme can display a colour gradient from a colour
			representing the minimum value in the selected annotation to a colour
			representing the maximum value in the selected annotation. Use the
			&quot;Min Colour&quot; and &quot;Max Colour&quot; to set the colour
			gradient range.
			<ul>
				<li><em>New in Jalview 2.7</em>: Press the &quot;Defaults&quot;
					button to reset the minimum and maximum colours to their default
					settings (these are configured in the applet's parameters or the <a
					href="../features/preferences.html">application's user
						preferences</a>.)
			</ul>
		</li>

		<li>Select whether to colour the alignment above or below an adjustable threshold 
    with the selection box center left of the window. </li>
		<li>Change the threshold value with the slider, or enter the
			exact value in the text box.
		</li>
		<li>Select the &quot;Threshold is Min/Max&quot; checkbox to
			assign colours using the thresholded range's minimum and maximum
			values, otherwise the scale will be defined by the range of values in
			the annotation row.</li>
