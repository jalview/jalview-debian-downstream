    <strong>Colouring above a percentage identity threshold</strong>
  </p>
  <p>Selecting this option causes the colour scheme to be applied to
    only those residues that occur in that column more than a certain
    percentage of the time. For instance selecting the threshold to be
    100 will only colour those columns with 100 % identity. This
    threshold option can be applied to the Zappo, Taylor, Hydrophobicity
    and User colour schemes.</p>
