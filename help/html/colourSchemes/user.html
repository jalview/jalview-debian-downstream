<p><em>User Defined Colours</em></p>
<p><img src="userDefined.gif" width="719" height="368"> </p>
<p>You may define any number of new colour schemes, each with a unique name. <br>
  <br>
  Each of the residues in a new colour scheme may be assigned a new user defined 
  colour. <br>
  <br>
  Click &quot;Apply&quot; or &quot;OK&quot; to set your new colours on the active 
  alignment window. </p>
<p>Click &quot;Cancel&quot; to undo your changes if you pressed the &quot;Apply&quot; 
  button. <br>
  <br>
  If you save your colour scheme with a unique name the colour scheme name will 
  be added to the &quot;Colour&quot; menu on each new alignment window.<br>
  <br>
  Any saved colour schemes will be automatically loaded the next time you use 
  Jalview.</p>
