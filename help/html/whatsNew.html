    <strong>What's new in Jalview 2.10.1 ?</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    Jalview 2.10.1 was released on 29th November 2016. Full details are
    in the <a href="releases.html#Jalview.2.10.1">Jalview 2.10.1
      Release Notes</a>, but the highlights are below. This is also the
    first release to include contributions from Kira Mour&atilde;o, who
    joined Jalview's core development team in October 2016.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>More memory efficient</strong><br />We've slimmed
      down the consensus analysis data structures used by Jalview so
      even wider alignments can be worked with.</li>
    <li><strong>Select highlighted region</strong><br />Press 'B'
      or use the new menu option in the alignment window's Select menu
      to mark columns containing highlighted regions generated from
      structure selections, mouse-overs, or resulting from a Find
      operation.</li>
    <li><strong>New custom link mechanism for opening URLs
        for database cross references.</strong><br /> If you have customised URL
      links in your Jalview preferences, then you may already have seen
      the <a href="#warning"> warning dialog (see below).</a></li>
    <li><strong>New command line export option for BioJS
        MSAviewer</strong><br />A number of small bugs with the HTML export
      functions from the Jalview desktop were also fixed.</li>
    <li><strong>Small but significant changes to the
        physicochemical properties and consensus calculations</strong><br />Threonine
      is no longer considered a non-hydrophobic residue in the protein
      conservation calculation, and minor bugs addressed in PID and
      consensus colouring.</li>
    <li><strong>Correct display of disulphide bond
        features</strong><br /> In linked structure views, Jalview would
      highlight all residues between in addition to the two linked
      cysteines. The 'select columns by feature' function in the feature
      settings would also select all intermediate columns.
  </ul>

  <p>
    <strong><a name="warning">Warning dialog about updating
        your configured URL links</a></strong><br /> In the desktop prior to Jalview
    2.10.1, the only way to configure custom links for a particular
    database cross-reference for a sequence was to give it a name that <em>exactly</em>
    matched the database source, and a regular expression for filtering
    out any spurious matches generated when the custom linked was tested
    against the Sequence's ID string. Since the introduction of the
    $DB_ACCESSION$ token, however, $SEQUENCE_ID$ will not be used for
    database cross-reference accession strings, and if you have custom
    links configured, Jalview will raise a warning message so let you
    know that you may need to update your links to use $DB_ACCESSION$.
