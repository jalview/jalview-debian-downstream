  </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong><a name="visual">Visual</a> Preferences tab</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>Maximise Window</em> - If this is selected, a new alignment
    window will stretch to fit the available space.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>Open Overview Window</em> - When this is selected, the <a
      href="overview.html"
    >alignment overview</a> panel is opened by default for a new alignment
    window.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>Show Annotations</em> - If this is selected the new window will
    display an annotation panel below the sequences. This annotation
    panel may have several rows describing the whole alignment. The 3
    standard annotations <em>Conservation</em>, <em>Quality</em> and <em>Consensus</em>
    for the alignment may be shown or hidden by default using the
    checkboxes below.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>Show group: Conservation and Consensus</em> controls the display
    of per-group automatic annotation.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>Consensus: Histogram and Logo</em> checkboxes control the
    display of the consensus histogram and sequence logo for consensus
    annotation rows.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>Full Sequence ID</em> - If selected the ID panel will display
    the name of a sequence plus the start and end residues in the format
    name/start-end. If not selected, the displayed ID will be the name
    of the sequence.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>Right Align IDs</em> - select to align all sequence IDs to the
    left-hand edge of the sequence alignment, rather than the left-hand
    edge of the alignment display window.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>Font</em> - The default font name, size and style can be set for
    a new alignment window.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>Sequence ID Tooltip</em>: Control the display of Database
    References and Non-positional annotation in the tooltip displayed
    when the mouse is over a sequence's ID.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>Show Unconserved</em> - When this is selected, all consensus
    sequence symbols will be rendered as a '.', highlighting mutations
    in highly conserved alignments.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>Sequence Name Italics</em> - select to apply the italicised
    version of the font to sequence labels.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>Smooth Font</em> - Toggles anti-aliasing on / off for faster
    rendering of the alignment.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>Gap Symbol</em> - The default gap symbol may be set to either
    &quot;-&quot; or &quot;.&quot;
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>Wrap Alignment</em> - Select whether to open new alignment
    windows in wrapped mode or not.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>Sort alignment by</em> - When the alignment is loaded in, it can
    be ordered as read (No sort), or sorted by Id or pairwise identity.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>Sort annotations by</em> - Annotations can be unsorted, sorted
    by the order of the related sequences in the alignment, or by label.
    Autocalculated annotations (e.g. Consensus) can be shown either last
    (below sequence annotations) or first (above sequence annotations).
    <em>Since Jalview 2.8.2.</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>Open file</em> - If this is selected then the default alignment
    file will be opened when Jalview is started. You can change the
    default file by clicking on file name and either typing in the file
    path or selecting it from the file chooser window.<br />
    <em>Note: The default example alignment is updated periodically
      to demonstrate new features in Jalview.</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <a name="colours"><strong>&quot;Colours&quot;
        Preferences tab</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>Alignment Colour</em> - The default colour scheme for a new
    alignment window. If the chosen option is &quot;User Defined&quot;
    then the last User Defined Colour loaded or saved via the User
    Defined Colours panel will be loaded.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>Annotation Shading Default</em> - set the default minimum and
    maximum colours used when <a
      href="../colourSchemes/annotationColouring.html"
    >Colour by Annotation...</a> is selected from the alignment window's
    colours menu.
  </p>
  <p>
    <a name="structure"><strong>&quot;Structure&quot;
        Preferences tab</strong></a><em> added in Jalview 2.8.2</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>Process secondary structure from PDB</em> - if selected, then
    structure information read from PDB will be processed and annotation
    added to associated sequences.
  <p>
    <em>Use RNAView for secondary structure</em> - if selected, the
    pyRNA RNAView service (<a href="https://github.com/fjossinet/PyRNA">https://github.com/fjossinet/PyRNA</a>)
    will be called to derive secondary structure information for RNA
    chains.
  <p>
    <em>Add secondary structure annotation to alignment</em> - if
    selected, <a href="http://swift.cmbi.ru.nl/gv/dssp/">Jmol's
      implementation DSSP</a> will be used to add annotation to polypeptide
    chains in the structure.
  <p>
    <em>Add Temperature Factor annotation to alignment</em> - if
    selected, values extracted from the Temperature Factor column for
    the backbone atoms in the PDB file will be extracted as annotation
    lines shown on the alignment.
  <p>
    <em>Default structure viewer</em> - choose JMOL or CHIMERA for
    viewing 3D structures.
  <p>
    <em>Path to Chimera program</em> - Optional, as Jalview will search
    standard installation paths for Windows, Linux or MacOS. If you have
    installed Chimera in a non-standard location, you can specify it
    here, by entering the full path to the Chimera executable program.
    Double-click this field to open a file chooser dialog.
  <p>
    <a name="connections"><strong>&quot;Connections&quot;
        Preferences tab</strong></a>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>URL Link From Sequence ID</em><br> These definitions are
    used to generate URLs from a sequence's ID or database cross
    references. Read more about <a
      href="../webServices/urllinks.html#urllinks"
    >configuring URL links here</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>Default Browser (Unix)</em><br> Its difficult in Java to
    detect the default web browser for Unix users. If Jalview can't find
    your default web browser, enter the name or full path to your web
    browser application.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>Proxy Server</em><br> If you normally use a proxy server
    for using the internet, you must tick the box &quot;Use a Proxy
    Server&quot; and enter the address and port details as necessary.
    Web Services will not work if you are using a proxy server and do
    not enter the settings here.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>Usage statistics, Questionnaire and Version checks</em><br>
    Uncheck these options to prevent Jalview from submitting usage
    statistics to google analytics, checking for Jalview questionnaires
    or retrieving details of the latest release version (at
    www.jalview.org). See the <a href="../privacy.html">user privacy
      statement</a> for more information.
  </p>
  <p>
    <a name="output"><strong>Output Preferences tab</strong></a>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>EPS Rendering Style</em><br> This is a selection box which
    allows the user to set a default rendering style for EPS export:
  <ul>
    <li>&quot;Prompt each time&quot;<br> Choose this to be
      asked select between Lineart and Text each time you make an EPS
      file.
    </li>
    <li>&quot;Lineart&quot;<br> EPS files will accurately
      reproduce the alignment view in Jalview and all characters will be
      converted into line art. Files generated in this way are large and
      are not easily editable, but have no font table dependencies.
    </li>
    <li>&quot;Text&quot;<br> EPS files will be a mixture of
      text and lineart. This produces compact files that can be edited
      easily in programs like Microsoft Word and Adobe Illustrator, but
      can be problematic if the fonts available to Jalview are not
      accessible by the program reading the EPS file.
  </ul>
  <p>
    <em>Automatically set ID width</em><br> When enabled, the
    column containing sequence and annotation labels at the left hand
    side of an exported figure will be made large enough to display each
    sequence ID and annotation label in its own line. Enable this if you
    have particularly long sequence IDs and need to generate EPS or PNG
    figures or web pages.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>Figure ID column width</em><br> Manually specify the width
    of the left hand column where sequence IDs and annotation labels
    will be rendered in exported alignment figures. This setting will be
    ignored if <em>&quot;Automatically set ID width&quot;</em> is set.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>Sequence//Start-End Numbering</em><br> The output tab also
    has a group of checkboxes for each file format. If these are ticked,
    then Jalview will write files with the start and end sequence
    positions appended to each sequence id:
  <pre>
  >ID/1-10
  AACDEAAFEA
</pre>
  <p>If the boxes are left unchecked for a particular format, the
    sequence limits will not be appended to the sequence id.</p>
  <p>
    <em>Embed BioJSON to HTML export</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    When this option is enabled, Jalview embeds <a
      href="bioJsonFormat.html"
    >BioJSON</a> data within HTML files exported from Jalview at
    generation time. This enables the exported HTML files to be
    extracted and imported back into the Jalview desktop application at
    a later time.
  <p>
    <em>Use Modeller Output</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    This option only applies to PIR format output. Jalview automatically
    reads PIR files with sequence descriptions compatible with the
    program <a href="http://salilab.org/modeller/">Modeller</a>. If this
    option is selected <a href="../io/modellerpir.html">Jalview will
      write Modeller style PIR files</a> with correct start/end numbering
    and PDB file association (if available). The Jalview id/start-end
    option is ignored if Modeller output is selected.
  <p>
    <a name="editing"><strong>Editing Preferences tab</strong></a>
  </p>
  <p>There are currently three options available which can be
    selected / deselected.</p>
  <p>
    <em>AutoCalculate Consensus</em> - For large alignments it can be
    useful to deselect &quot;Autocalculate Consensus&quot; when editing.
    This prevents lengthy calculations which are performed after each
    sequence edit. New alignment windows will have their
    &quot;Autocalculate Consensus&quot; option set according to this
    setting.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>Pad Gaps when Editing</em> - New alignment windows will
    &quot;Pad Gaps&quot; according to this setting.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>Sort with New Tree</em> - When selected, any trees calculated or
    loaded onto the alignment will automatically sort the alignment.
