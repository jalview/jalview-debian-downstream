</ul>
</p>
<p><strong><a name="visual">Visual</a> Preferences tab</strong></p>
<p><em>Maximise Window</em> - If this is selected, a new alignment
window will stretch to fit the available space.</p>
<p><em>Open Overview Window</em> - When this is selected, the <a
	href="overview.html">alignment overview</a> panel is opened by default
for a new alignment window.</p>
<p><em>Show Annotations</em> - If this is selected the new window
will display an annotation panel below the sequences. This annotation
panel may have several rows describing the whole alignment. The 3
standard annotations <em>Conservation</em>, <em>Quality</em> and <em>Consensus</em>
for the alignment may be shown or hidden by default using the checkboxes
below.</p>
<p><em>Show group: Conservation and Consensus</em> controls the
display of per-group automatic annotation.</p>
<p><em>Consensus: Histogram and Logo</em> checkboxes control the
display of the consensus histogram and sequence logo for consensus
annotation rows.</p>
<p><em>Full Sequence ID</em> - If selected the ID panel will display
the name of a sequence plus the start and end residues in the format
name/start-end. If not selected, the displayed ID will be the name of
the sequence.</p>
<p><em>Right Align IDs</em> - select to align all sequence IDs to
the left-hand edge of the sequence alignment, rather than the left-hand
edge of the alignment display window.</p>
<p><em>Font</em> - The default font name, size and style can be set
for a new alignment window.</p>
<p><em>Sequence ID Tooltip</em>: Control the display of Database
References and Non-positional annotation in the tooltip displayed when
the mouse is over a sequence's ID.</p>
<p><em>Sequence Name Italics</em> - select to apply the italicised
vbersion of the font to sequence labels.</p>
<p><em>Smooth Font</em> - Toggles anti-aliasing on / off for faster
rendering of the alignment.</p>
<p><em>Wrap Alignment</em> - Select whether to open new alignment
windows in wrapped mode or not.</p>
<p><em>Gap Symbol</em> - The default gap symbol may be set to either
&quot;-&quot; or &quot;.&quot;</p>
<p><em>Sort by</em> - When the alignment is loaded in, it will can
be sorted by Id or pairwise identity.</p>
<p><em>Open file</em> - If this is selected then the default
alignment file will be opened when Jalview is started. You can change
the default file by clicking on file name and either typing in the file
path or selecting it from the file chooser window.</p>
<p><a name="colours"><strong>&quot;Colours&quot; Preferences tab</strong></p>
<p><em>Alignment Colour</em> - The default colour scheme for a new alignment
window. If the chosen option is &quot;User Defined&quot; then the last
User Defined Colour loaded or saved via the User Defined Colours panel
will be loaded.</p>
	<p>
		<em>Annotation Shading Default</em> - set the default minimum
		and maximum colours used when <a
			href="../colourSchemes/annotationColouring.html">Colour by
			Annotation ..</a> is selected from the alignment window's colours menu.
	</p>
	<br>
	</p>
<p><a name="connections"><strong>&quot;Connections&quot;
Preferences tab</strong></a></p>
<p><em>URL Link From Sequence ID</em><br>
These definitions are used to generate URLs from a sequence's ID or
database cross references. Read more about <a
	href="../webServices/urllinks.html#urllinks">configuring URL links
here</a>.</p>
<p><em>Default Browser (Unix)</em><br>
Its difficult in Java to detect the default web browser for Unix users.
If Jalview can't find your default web browser, enter the name or full
path to your web browser application.</p>
<p><em>Proxy Server</em><br>
If you normally use a proxy server for using the internet, you must tick
the box &quot;Use a Proxy Server&quot; and enter the address and port
details as necessary. Web Services will not work if you are using a
proxy server and do not enter the settings here.</p>
<p><em>Usage statistics, Questionnaire and Version checks</em><br>
Uncheck these options to prevent Jalview from submitting usage
statistics to google analytics, checking for jalview questionnaires or
retrieving details of the latest release version (at www.jalview.org).
See the <a href="../privacy.html">user privacy statement</a> for more
information.</p>
<p><a name="output"><strong>Output Preferences tab</strong></a></p>
<p><em>EPS Rendering Style</em><br>
This is a selection box which allows the user to set a default rendering
style for EPS export:
<ul>
	<li>&quot;Lineart&quot;<br>
	EPS files will accurately reproduce the alignment view in Jalview and
	all characters will be converted into line art. Files generated in this
	way are large and are not easily editable, but have no font table
	dependencies.</li>
	<li>&quot;Text&quot;<br>
	EPS files will be a mixture of text and lineart. This produces compact
	files that can be edited easily in programs like Microsoft Word and
	Adobe Illustrator, but can be problematic if the fonts available to
	jalview are not accessible by the program reading the EPS file.
	<li>&quot;Prompt each time&quot;<br>
	Choose this to be asked select between Lineart and Text each time you
	make an EPS file.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p><em>Sequence//Start-End Numbering</em><br>
The output tab also has a group of checkboxes for each file format. If
these are ticked, then Jalview will write files with the start and end
sequence positions appended to each sequence id: <pre>
  >ID/1-10
  AACDEAAFEA
</pre>
<p>If the boxes are left unchecked for a particular format, the
sequence limits will not be appended to the sequence id.</p>
</p>
<p><em>Use Modeller Output</em></p>
<p>This option only applies to PIR format output. Jalview
automatically reads PIR files with sequence descriptions compatible with
the program <a href="http://salilab.org/modeller/">Modeller</a>. If this
option is selected <a href="../io/modellerpir.html">Jalview will
write Modeller style PIR files</a> with correct start/end numbering and PDB
file association (if available). The Jalview id/start-end option is
ignored if Modeller output is selected.
<p><a name="editing"><strong>Editing Preferences tab</strong></a></p>
<p>There are currently 2 options available which can be selected /
deselected.</p>
<p><em>AutoCalculate Consensus</em> - For large alignments it can be
useful to deselect &quot;Autocalculate Consensus&quot; when editing.
This prevents lengthy calculations which are performed after each
sequence edit. New alignment windows will have their &quot;Autocalculate
Consensus&quot; option set according to this setting.</p>
<p><em>Pad gaps when editing</em> - New alignment windows will
&quot;Pad Gaps&quot; according to this setting.</p>
