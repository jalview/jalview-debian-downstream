    <strong>Split Frame Views</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    Jalview provides a special viewing mode to show Coding DNA (cDNA)
    and protein product alignments as a split view, with cDNA above and
    protein below. The two alignments are linked, allowing editing and
    analysis to be performed at both the peptide and nucleotide level.
    Linked protein alignments also have an additional <strong>cDNA
      Consensus</strong> annotation row, showing the distribution of codons at
    each column of the protein alignment.
  </p>
  <p>
    Split Frame views can be <a href="#opensplit">created in a
      number of ways</a>. In the Jalview Desktop, Split Frame views are
    saved in Jalview Projects, like any other alignment view.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Operations supported in Split Frame Mode</strong>
  </p>
  <p>Split Frame views allow the following:
  <ul>
    <li>Mouseover or scrolling of either alignment is followed by
      the other (unless you turn off <strong><a
        href="../menus/alwview.html"
      >"View&#8594;Automatic Scrolling"</a></strong>)
    </li>
    <li>On selecting rows, columns or regions in one alignment, the
      corresponding selection is made in the other</li>
    <li>Sequence ordering in one alignment (using the cursor, or <strong><a
        href="../calculate/sorting.html"
      >"Calculate&#8594;Sort")</a></strong> is also applied to the other
    </li>
    <li>Editing (gap insertion / deletion) in the protein alignment
      is reflected in the cDNA (but not vice versa)</li>
    <li>Any trees imported or created with <strong><a
        href="../calculations/tree.html"
      >"Calculate Tree"</a></strong> on one of the views allow both cDNA and
      Protein views to be grouped, coloured or sorted.
    </li>
    <li>To allow for the different widths in cDNA and Protein
      alignments, the <strong><a href="../menus/alwformat.html">"Format&#8594;Font"</a></strong>
      menu option has an option 'Scale protein residues to codons'. This
      option will make each protein residue the same width as a DNA
      codon (so the alignments 'line up' vertically)
    </li>
    <li><strong>"View&#8594;Protein"</strong> (in the cDNA panel)
      or <strong>"View&#8594;Nucleotide"</strong> (in the protein panel)
      allows you to show or hide one or other of the linked alignment
      panels.</li>
    <li>Panel heights are adjusted dragging the divider between
      them using the mouse</li>
    <li><a href="menus/alwview.html"><strong>"View&#8594;New
          View / Expand Views / Gather Views"</strong></a> behave as for a normal
      alignment window, but always create new views as Split Frames</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    An alignment annotation row on the protein alignment shows the <strong><a
      href="../calculations/consensus.html"
    >cDNA consensus</a></strong> for each peptide column.<br /> This consensus may
    reveal variation in nucleotides coding for conserved protein
    residues.

    <strong>Opening a Split Frame View</strong>
  </p>
  <p>A Split Frame View can be opened in one of the following ways:</p>
  <p>
    <strong><em>Add Sequences</em></strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    If you add (coding) DNA sequences to an open peptide alignment, or
    vice versa, <em>and</em> at least one DNA sequence translates to one
    of the peptide sequences, then the option to open in a split window
    is offered. The DNA may include start and/or stop codons, but no
    non-coding (intron) sequence.<br> If more than one cDNA variant
    is present in the alignment, Jalview will first try to match these
    to protein sequences based on any retrieved cross-references, and
    failing that, pairwise as they are ordered in the alignments.
  <p>This option is available in Jalview Desktop (when adding
    sequences by any supported method), and Jalview applet (adding from
    textbox). The additional options below apply to Jalview Desktop
    only.</p>

  <p>
    <strong><em>Translate as cDNA</em></strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    Menu option <strong><a href="../menus/alwcalculate.html">"Calculate&#8594;Translate
        as cDNA"</a></strong> is available for a nucleotide alignment. Selecting this
    option shows the DNA and its calculated protein product in a Split
    Frame view.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong><em>Get Cross-References</em></strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    Menu option <strong><a href="../menus/alwcalculate.html">"Calculate&#8594;Get
        Cross-References"</a></strong> is available for fetched sequences which have
    cross-references to other databases. On selecting protein
    cross-references (for a cDNA alignment), or DNA xrefs (for peptide),
    a Split Frame view is opened showing cDNA and peptide.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong><em>Realign a Split View</em></strong>
  </p>
  <p>If you invoke a web service to realign either half of a Split
    Frame, then the resulting realignment is displayed in a new Split
    Frame.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>the alignment you chose to realign (for example, peptide)
      is displayed as aligned by the external web service</li>
    <li>Jalview reconstructs the alignment of its complement (in
      this case, cDNA) by inserting gaps in the corresponding positions</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    <a name="reconalignment" /><strong>Reconstructed
      Alignments</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    Reconstructed alignments are typically <em>not</em> the same as the
    alignment produced by aligning the complement sequence set directly
    with the external service. However, in the case of protein
    alignments, a reconstructed cDNA alignment is often more reliable
    than one calculated without coding information. Reconstructed cDNA
    alignments are also more informative than the original protein
    alignment when calculating phylogenetic trees or performing other
    kinds of molecular evolution analysis.
