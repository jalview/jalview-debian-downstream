    <strong>Jalview Project Archives</strong>
  </p>

  <p>These are java archives of an XML file containing alignments,
    trees and Jalview display information. A data exchange standard is
    currently being developed, so there is no stable schema yet, but
    Jalview web services will soon make use of the same interchange
    format.</p>
  <p>
    For those who want to know...<br> Jalview uses java classes
    automatically created using <a href="http://www.castor.org">Castor</a>.
    Jalview 2.08 uses descriptor classes which significantly increase
    the speed of marshalling / unmarshalling java objects into XML.
    Files created prior to Jalview 2.08 can still be read in, but they
    will be saved in the new format.
