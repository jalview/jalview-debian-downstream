<title>Groovy Shell</title>
</head>
<body>
  <p>
    <strong>The Groovy Shell</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="http://groovy.codehaus.org/">Groovy</a> is an &quot;<em>agile
      and dynamic language for the Java platform</em>&quot;. The groovy
    scripting language makes it extremely easy to programmatically
    interact with Java programs, in much the same way that Javascript is
    used to generate and interact with applets and other objects on the
    page.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong><em>Getting Groovy...</em> </strong><br> Jalview Groovy
    support is only possible if the core groovy jars which include the
    GroovyShell are present on the CLASSPATH when Jalview is started.
  </p>
  <p>
    The jars are obtained from the <em>embedded</em> directory within
    the <a href="http://dist.codehaus.org/groovy/distributions">groovy
      distribution</a>. The easiest way of adding them to the Jalview
    classpath is to download and build Jalview from its source
    distribution, and then add the groovy-all-*.jar to the lib directory
    whose path is given in the java.ext.dirs property.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Opening Jalview's Groovy Console</strong><br>If groovy
    is available, then the <strong>Tools&#8594;Groovy
      Console...</strong> menu entry will be available from the Jalview Desktop's
    drop-down menu. Selecting this will open the <a
      href="http://groovy.codehaus.org/Groovy+Console"
    >Groovy Console</a> which allows you to interactively execute Groovy
    scripts within the Jalview run-time environment.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Executing groovy scripts on Jalview startup</strong><br>
    The -groovy &lt;script&gt; option on the <a href="commandline.html">
      Jalview command line</a> will execute the contents of &lt;script&gt;.
    &lt;script&gt; may be a file, a URL, or alternatively if it is
    &quot;STDIN&quot; then the standard input will be used.<br> <em>Note:
      The groovy script will be executed <strong>after</strong> any data
      is loaded, and <strong>before</strong> images or any output files
      are written. This allows you to perform customised Jalview
      analysis workflows with groovy.
    </em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Access to Jalview's functions from Groovy Scripts</strong><br>
    There is as yet no properly defined scripting interface to Jalview,
    but all the public methods of the jalview class hierarchy can be
    called from Groovy scripts. The access point for this is the <strong>Jalview</strong>
    object defined in the groovy environent which corresponds to the
  <pre>jalview.gui.Desktop</pre>
  object which manages all the Jalview windows. Here's an example to get
  you started:
  <br>
  <ul>
    <li>Getting the title, alignment and first sequence from the
      current alignFrame<br> <pre>
def alf = Jalview.getAlignFrames();
print alf[0].getTitle();
def alignment = alf[0].viewport.alignment;
def seq = alignment.getSequenceAt(0);
</pre>
    </li>
    <li>When running a groovy script from the command line, the
      alignment that was just loaded can be referred to like so:<br>
    <pre>
print currentAlFrame.getTitle();</pre>
  </ul>
  If you have downloaded the InstallAnywhere version of Jalview, you can
  find additional groovy scripts in the examples/groovy subfolder of the
  installation directory.
