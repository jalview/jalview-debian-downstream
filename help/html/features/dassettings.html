<body>
<p><strong>DAS Settings</strong></p>
<p>Jalview can retrieve sequences and features from many <a
	href="http://biodas.org/">DAS</a> sources. The DAS sources that
it uses are discovered and selected <em>via</em> the DAS settings panel,
opened either from the <a href="featuresettings.html">View&#8594;Feature
Settings</a> dialog box from the alignment window's menu bar, or the <a
	href="featuresettings.html">Tools&#8594;Preferences</a> dialog box
opened from the Desktop menu bar.</p>
<p><img src="das.gif">
<p>The available sources are listed in the table using each source's
Nickname as its identifier. Clicking on a source's entry in the table
reveals more information about that service in the panel to the right.
Select the tickbox in the &quot;Use Source&quot; column for a source to
add it to the set Jalview queries for alignment and sequence features.</p>
<p>You can filter the visible DAS sources by authority, type and
&quot;label&quot;. You should read the DAS documentation to understand
more about these values.
<p><strong>Updating the list of sources</strong></p>
<p>When the DAS Settings panel is first opened, and when the <strong>'Refresh
source'</strong> buton is pressed, a list of DAS sources is retrieved from the
DAS registry URL (set by default to the DAS registration server at
http://das.sanger.ac.uk/registry/das1/sources/).</p>
<p><strong>Adding your own DAS Sources</strong></p>
<p>You can add your own DAS source to the list by clicking the
&quot;Add Local Source&quot; button. Enter the URL and nickname of your
additional service. It should be noted that Jalview 2.1 will not query
additional sources for more information, but this will be implemented in
future editions.
