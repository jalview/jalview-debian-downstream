<p><strong>Viewing PDB Structures</strong></p>

<p>Jalview can view protein structures associated with a sequence
via the <strong>"Structure&rarr;View PDB entry:"</strong> entries from a
sequence's <a href="../menus/popupMenu.html">pop-up menu</a>. Once a pdb
structure is selected, one of the following will happen:</p>

<ul>
	<li>If no structures are open, then an interactive display of the
	structure will be opened in a new window</li>

	<li>If another structure is already shown for the current
	alignment, then you will be asked if you want to add and <a
		href="jmol.html#align">align this structure</a> to the structure in
	the existing view. (<em>new feature in Jalview 2.6</em>)</li>

	<li>If the structure is already shown, then you will be prompted
	to associate the sequence with an existing view of the selected
	structure. This is useful when working with multi-domain or multi-chain PDB files.</li>

	<li style="list-style: none">See the <a href="jmol.html">Jmol
	PDB viewer</a> help page for more information about the display.</li>
</ul>
	<p>
		<em>Opening structures associated with the current selection</em><br />
		If one or more of the sequences in the alignment are selected, then
		the Structure submenu of the <a href="../menus/popupMenu.html">Sequence
			ID popup menu</a> will contain will include either a 'View all <em>X</em>
		structures' entry in the submenu or a 'View structure for <em>Sequence</em>'
		entry. Both these options will open a new Jmol view containing one, or
		all the structures available for all selected sequences, superimposed
		using the currently selected region of the alignment. (<em>This
			capability was added in Jalview 2.7</em>)
	</p>
	<p><strong>Associating PDB files with Sequences</strong></p>
	<p>To associate PDB files with a sequence, right click on a sequence
ID and select "Structure<strong>&rarr;</strong> Associate Structure with
Sequence", and one of the submenus:</p>

<ul>
	<li>From File - You can load a PDB file from the local machine or
	network and associate it with the selected sequence. PDB files
	associated in this way will also be saved in the <a
		href="jalarchive.html">Jalview Archive file</a>.<br>
	</li>

	<li>Enter PDB Id - Jalview will use WSDBFetch, provided by the
	EBI, to fetch the PDB file with the entered Id.<br>
	</li>

	<li>Discover PDB Ids - Jalview uses the sequence's ID to query WSDBFetch, provided by the
	EBI, and any enabled DAS servers, to discover PDB ids associated with the sequence.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Importing PDB Entries or files in PDB format</strong><br>
You can retrieve sequences from the PDB using the <a
	href="seqfetch.html">Sequence Fetcher</a>. Any sequences retrieved with
this service are automatically associated with their source database
entry. For PDB sequences, simply select PDB as the database and enter
your known PDB id (appended with ':' and a chain code, if desired).<br>
Jalview will also read PDB files directly. Simply load in the file as
you would an alignment file. The sequences of any peptide chains will be
extracted from the file and viewed in the alignment window.</p>

<p>
<strong>Associating a large number of PDB files to sequences
in an alignment</strong><br /> It is often the case when working with
structure alignments that you will have a directory of PDB files, and
an alignment involving one or more of the structures. If you drag a
number of PDB files onto an alignment in the Jalview desktop, Jalview
will give you the option of associating PDB files with sequences that
have the same filename. This means, for example, you can automatically
associate PDB files with names like '1gaq.pdb' with sequences that
have an ID like '1gaq'.
<br/><em>Note: This feature was added in Jalview 2.7</em>
</p>
<p><em>Note for jalview applet users:<br>
Due to the applet security constraints, PDB Files can currently only be
imported by cut and paste of the PDB file text into the text box opened
by the 'From File' entry of the structure menu.</em></p>

<p><strong>Viewing the PDB Residue Numbering</strong><br>
Sequences which have PDB entry or PDB file associations are annotated
with sequence features from a group named with the associated PDB
accession number or file name. Each feature gives the corresponding PDB
Residue Number for each mapped residue in the sequence. The display of
these features is controlled through the <strong>"View&rarr;Sequence
Features"</strong> menu item and the <a href="featuresettings.html">Feature
Settings dialog box</a>.</p>

<p><em><strong>Outstanding problem with cut'n'pasted
files in Jalview 2.6 and Jalview 2.7</strong><br>
Structures imported via the cut'n'paste dialog box will not be correctly
highlighted or coloured when they are displayed in structure views,
especially if they contain more than one PDB structure. See the bug
report at http://issues.jalview.org/browse/JAL-623 for news on this problem.</em></p>
