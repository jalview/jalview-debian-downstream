<title>PDB Viewing</title>
</head>
<body>
  <p>
    <strong>Viewing PDB Structures</strong>
  </p>
  Jalview can be used to view protein structures by following the steps
  below:
  <ol>
    <li>Select the <strong>"3D Structure Data..."</strong> option
      from a sequence's <a href="../menus/popupMenu.html">pop-up
        menu</a> to open the <a href="structurechooser.html">Structure
        Chooser</a> dialog box.
      <ul>
        <li>If one or more structures exists for the given
          sequence, the <a href="structurechooser.html">Structure
            Chooser</a> dialog will open with them listed in the results
          pane.
        </li>
        <li>However, if no structure was found, the <a
          href="structurechooser.html"
        >Structure Chooser</a> interface will present options for manual
          association of PDB structures.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Selecting Structures</strong><br /> If structures
      have been discovered, then some will already be selected according
      to predefined selection criteria, such as structures with the
      highest resolution. Use the drop down menu to select structures
      according to different criteria, or, alternatively, choose
      structures manually by selecting with the keyboard and mouse.
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Viewing Cached Structures</strong><br />If you
          have previously downloaded structures for your sequences, they
          can be viewed by selecting the <strong>Cached PDB
            Entries</strong> option from the drop down menu at the top of the
          dialog box.</li>
      </ul></li>
    <li>To view selected structures, click the <strong>"View"</strong>
      button.
    </li>
  </ol>

  The
  <a href="jmol.html">Jmol viewer</a> has been included since Jalview
  2.3. Jalview 2.8.2 included support for
  <a href="chimera.html">Chimera</a>, provided it is installed and can
  be launched by Jalview. The default viewer can be configured in the
  <a href="preferences.html#structure">Structure tab</a> in the
  <strong>Tools&rarr;Preferences</strong> dialog box.
  <p>
    Structure data imported into Jalview can also be processed to
    display secondary structure and temperature factor annotation. See
    the <a href="xsspannotation.html">Annotation from Structure</a> page
    for more information.
  </p>

  <p>
    If a <strong>single</strong> PDB structure is selected, one of the
    following will happen:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>If no structures are open, then an interactive display of
      the structure will be opened in a new window.</li>

    <li>If another structure is already shown for the current
      alignment, then you will be asked if you want to add and <a
      href="jmol.html#align"
    >align this structure</a> to the structure in the existing view. (<em>new
        feature in Jalview 2.6</em>).
    </li>

    <li>If the structure is already shown, then you will be
      prompted to associate the sequence with an existing view of the
      selected structure. This is useful when working with multi-domain
      or multi-chain PDB files.</li>

    <li style="list-style: none">See the <a href="jmol.html">Jmol
    </a> and <a href="chimera.html">Chimera</a> PDB viewer help pages for
      more information about the display.
    </li>
  </ul>


  <p>
    <strong>Importing PDB Entries or files in PDB format</strong><br>
    You can retrieve sequences from the PDB using the <a
      href="pdbsequencefetcher.html"
    >Sequence Fetcher</a>. Any sequences retrieved with this service are
    automatically associated with their source database entry. For PDB
    sequences, simply select PDB as the database and enter your known
    PDB id (appended with ':' and a chain code, if desired).<br>
    Jalview will also read PDB files directly. Simply load in the file
    as you would an alignment file. The sequences of any protein or
    nucleotide chains will be extracted from the file and viewed in the
    alignment window.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Associating a large number of PDB files to
      sequences in an alignment</strong><br /> It is often the case when working
    with structure alignments that you will have a directory of PDB
    files, and an alignment involving one or more of the structures. If
    you drag a number of PDB files onto an alignment in the Jalview
    desktop, Jalview will give you the option of associating PDB files
    with sequences that have the same filename. This means, for example,
    you can automatically associate PDB files with names like '1gaq.pdb'
    with sequences that have an ID like '1gaq'. <br />
    <em>Note: This feature was added in Jalview 2.7</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>Note for Jalview applet users:<br> Due to the applet
      security constraints, PDB Files can currently only be imported by
      cut and paste of the PDB file text into the text box opened by the
      'From File' entry of the structure menu.
    </em>
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Viewing the PDB Residue Numbering</strong><br>
    Sequences which have PDB entry or PDB file associations are
    annotated with sequence features from a group named with the
    associated PDB accession number or file name. Each feature gives the
    corresponding PDB Residue Number for each mapped residue in the
    sequence. The display of these features is controlled through the <strong>"View&rarr;Sequence
      Features"</strong> menu item and the <a href="featuresettings.html">Feature
      Settings dialog box</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    <em><strong>Outstanding problem with cut'n'pasted
        files in Jalview 2.6 and Jalview 2.7</strong><br> Structures
      imported via the cut'n'paste dialog box will not be correctly
      highlighted or coloured when they are displayed in structure
      views, especially if they contain more than one PDB structure. See
      the bug report at http://issues.jalview.org/browse/JAL-623 for
      news on this problem.</em>
