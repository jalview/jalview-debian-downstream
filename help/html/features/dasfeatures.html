    <strong>DAS Sequence Feature Retrieval</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    Jalview includes a client for retrieving sequences and their
    features via the <a href="http://www.biodas.org">Distributed
      Annotation System</a>.
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Open the Feature Settings panel by selecting &quot;View
      -&gt; Feature Settings...&quot;</li>
    <li>Click on the &quot;<a href="dassettings.html">DAS
        Settings</a>&quot; tabbed pane.
    </li>
    <li>Select the sources to use for DAS feature retrieval, then
      click the &quot;Fetch DAS Features&quot; button.
      <ul>
        <li>Cancelling Feature Retrieval<br> Press the <strong>Cancel
            Fetch</strong> button to immediately stop feature retrieval. This
          will not remove any features already added to the alignment,
          but will halt any outstanding DAS requests.<em>The cancel
            fetch button is of particular use when one or more DAS
            annotation servers are not responding!</em>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    If your DAS source selection contains sources which use Uniprot
    accession ids, you will be asked whether Jalview should find Uniprot
    Accession ids for the given sequence names. It is important to
    realise that many DAS sources only use Uniprot accession ids, rather
    than Swissprot/Uniprot sequence names.<br> The <a
      href="../webServices/dbreffetcher.html"
    >database reference fetcher</a> documentation describes how Jalview
    discovers what database references are appropriate for the sequences
    in the alignment.
  <ul>
    <li><em>Note</em><br> Please remember to save your
      alignment if either the start/end numbering, or the sequence IDs
      were updated during the ID retrieval process.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>&nbsp;
  <p>
    <em>DAS support was introduced in Jalview Version 2.1.</em>
