    <strong>Sequence feature colour schemes</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    Jalview can visualize annotation present on parts of a sequence by
    overlaying colours according to the annotation present at each
    position. It allows features to be colored either according to type,
    or for a particular type, according to an individual feature's
    associated label or score. The <a href="featuresettings.html">Feature
      Settings dialog box</a> controls the order and display of each
    sequence annotation type, and also allows the colour scheme used for
    the the feature to be changed <em>via</em> the 'Graduated Colour'
    option in the sequence feature pop-up menu (obtained by
    right-clicking on a sequence feature).

    colour scheme settings dialog box</img>
  </center>
  <p>The Graduated Feature Colour dialog box has the following
    controls:
  <ul>
    <li><em>Colour by Label</em> - when checked this derives a
      colour for each feature based on the label text.</li>
    <li><em>Min and Max Color boxes</em> - Click on these boxes to
      set the minimum and maximum colours used to shade features by
      their associated score.</li>
    <li><em>Threshold type combo box</em> - Allows features to be
      hidden features if their score is below or above a given
      threshold.<br /> <em>Set the threshold using the slider or
        type it in to the text box. The threshold cannot be set outside
        the available range of feature scores.</em></li>
    <li><em>Threshold is Min/Max</em> - When checked, the threshold
      will be used as the upper or lower limit when shading the features
      according to their score using the Min and Max colour.</li>
  </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Icon styles for graduated feature styles</strong><br />
  <p>
    When a graduated colourscheme is applied to a feature, it is
    indicated in the feature settings or amend feature dialog box by the
    following types of icon:<br />
  <center>
    <table width="50%" border="1">
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Type of Colouring</strong></td>
        <td><strong>Icon</strong></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><em>Graduated colour by Feature Score</em></td>
        <td><img src="fcsminmax.gif" /></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><em>Graduated colour thresholded (less than) by
            feature Score</em></td>
        <td><img src="fcsltthan.gif" /></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><em>Graduated colour thresholded (greater than) by
            feature Score</em></td>
        <td><img src="fcsgtthan.gif" /></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><em>Colour by Feature Label (may also be
            thresholded)</em></td>
        <td><img src="fcsntlabel.gif" /></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td align="center" colspan="2"><em> <strong>The
              current threshold is given in the icon's tooltip.</strong>
        </em></td>
      </tr>
    </table>
