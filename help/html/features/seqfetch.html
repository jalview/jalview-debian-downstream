<p><strong>Sequence Fetcher</strong></p>
<p>Jalview can retrieve sequences from certain databases using
either the WSDBFetch service provided by the European Bioinformatics
Institute, and, since Jalview 2.4, DAS servers capable of the <em>sequence</em>
command (configured in <a href="dassettings.html">DAS settings</a>).</p>
<img src="seqfetcher.gif" align="center"
	alt="The Jalview Sequence Fetcher Dialog Box">
<p>The Sequence Fetcher dialog box can be opened via the
&quot;File&quot; menu on the main desktop in order to retrieve sequences
as a new alignment, or opened via the &quot;File&quot; menu of an
existing alignment to import additional sequences. Please note, there
will be a short delay when the sequence fetcher is first opened, whilst
Jalview compiles the list of available sequence datasources from the
currently defined DAS server registry.</strong></p>
<p>First, select the database you want to retrieve sequences from.
Then, enter one or more accession ids (as a semi-colon separated list),
or press the &quot;Example&quot; button to paste the example accession
for the currently selected database into the retrieval box. Finally,
press &quot;OK&quot; to initiate the retrieval.</p>
<p><em>Fetching Individual PDB Chains</em><br>
If you are retrieving sequences from the PDB, you can retrieve specific
chains by appending a colon and the chain id to the PDB id. For example
:<br>
<pre> 1GAQ:A</pre>
</p>
<p><em>Retrieving parts of large sequence records</em><br>
When retrieving from DAS sequence sources, coordinate range arguments
can be passed to the server using the standard DAS sequence command
format:<pre>
  &lt;AccessionId&gt;:&lt;start&gt;,&lt;end&gt;</pre> If you know a source
understands this type of query format, then you should untick the
checkbox for 'replace commas with semi-colons' so the range query can be
passed to the server; otherwise, the query will be split into two (e.g
'Mito:1' and '85779' rather than 'Mito:1,85779'). In most cases,
however, a source that supports range queries will include a range
qualification in its example query, and Jalview will then automatically
disable the 'replace commas with semi-colons' option.<br>
<em>The option to disable the comma to semi-colon translation was
added in Jalview 2.6</em></p>
