    <strong>Sequence Fetcher</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    Jalview can retrieve sequences from certain databases using either
    the DBFetch service provided by the EMBL European Bioinformatics
    Institute, or, since Jalview 2.4, DAS servers capable of the <em>sequence</em>
    command (configured in <a href="dassettings.html">DAS settings</a>).
  </p>

    alt="The Jalview Sequence Fetcher Dialog Box"
  >
  <p>The Sequence Fetcher dialog box can be opened via the
    &quot;File&quot; menu on the main desktop in order to retrieve
    sequences as a new alignment, or opened via the &quot;File&quot;
    menu of an existing alignment to import additional sequences. There
    may be a short delay when the sequence fetcher is first opened,
    whilst Jalview compiles the list of available sequence datasources
    from the currently defined DAS server registry.</p>
  <p>
    First, <strong>select the database you want to retrieve
      sequences from</strong> by clicking the button labeled 'Select database
    retrieval source'. If a database source is already selected, then
    the button's label will change to show the currently selected
    database.
  </p>

    alt="Database selection dialog for fetching sequences (introduced in Jalview 2.8)"
  >
  <p>Since Jalview 2.8, the available databases are shown as a tree
    in a popup dialog box. The databases are ordered alphabetically, and
    if there are many sources for the same type of sequence identifier,
    they will be grouped together in a sub-branch branch labeled with
    the identifier.</p>
  <p>
    Once you have selected the sequence database using the popup dialog
    box, <strong>enter one or more accession ids</strong> (as a
    semi-colon separated list), or press the &quot;Example&quot; button
    to paste the example accession for the currently selected database
    into the retrieval box. Finally, press &quot;OK&quot; to initiate
    the retrieval.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Fetching from The PDB with the EMBL-EBI PDBe Search
      Interface</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    Since Jalview 2.9, selecting PDB as the sequence database will open
    the <a href="pdbsequencefetcher.html">PDB Sequence Fetcher</a> for
    discovering and retrieving structures.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Only retrieving part of a sequence</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    DAS sources (indicated by a &quot;<em>(DAS)</em>&quot;) allow a
    range to be specified in addition to a sequence ID. To retrieve 50
    residues starting at position 35 in UNIPROT sequence P73137 using
    the UNIPROT DAS server, you would enter &quot;'P73137:35,84'.<br />
    <em>Full support for DAS range queries was introduced in
      Jalview 2.8</em>
