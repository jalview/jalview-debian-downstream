    <strong>Structure Chooser</strong>
  </p>

  The Structure Chooser interface provides a smart technique for
  selecting PDB structures to view in Jalview by querying readily
  available meta-data of structures. The Interface can be invoked by
  selecting the
  <strong>"3D Structure Data.."</strong> option from a sequence's
  <a href="../menus/popupMenu.html">pop-up menu</a>. Some of the main
  features it provides are listed below:
  <ul>
    <li>Automatic discovery, retrieval and association of PDB
      entries for an alignment's sequences</li>
    <li>Visualisation of discovered structures' meta-data</li>
    <li>Ability to configure the meta-data entries to visualise</li>
    <li>Auto-selection of the best structure via filtering by the
      available metric parameters in the meta-data (i.e. resolution,
      quality etc).</li>
    <li>Selection of multiple structures in a single operation</li>
  </ul>
  Additionally, the Structure Chooser retains the following contemporary
  features of Jalview:
  <ul>
    <li>Manual association of PDB entries via entering the PDB Id
      or From File</li>
    <li>Ability to view cached PDB entries</li>
  </ul>


  <strong>Associating PDB files with Sequences</strong>
  <br> Discovery/Association of PDB entries to a sequence now
  happens automatically during the initialisation of the Structure
  Chooser Interface. Jalview uses the sequence's ID to query the PDB
  Rest API provided by the EBI to discover PDB Ids associated with the
  sequence.

  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Configuring displayed meta-data for Structures</strong>
  <br> To configure the visible meta-data displayed for the
  discovered structures, click the 'Configure Displayed Columns' tab,
  then tick the options which you intend to make visible.

  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Auto-selection of best Structures</strong>
  <br> Jalview can automatically filter and select the best
  structures using various metric categories avaialble from the
  meta-data of the structures. To perform this simply select any of the
  following options from the drop-down menu in the Structure Chooser
  interface: Best Uniprot coverage, Higest Resolution, Best Quality,
  Highest Protein Chain etc. When the 'Invert' option is selected,
  Jalview returns an inverse result for the current selected option in
  the drop-down menu.

    <br>The screenshot above shows the Structure Chooser interface
    along with the meta-data of auto-discovered structures for the
    sample alignment. Note however that if no structures were
    auto-discovered, a different interface for manual association will
    be invoked as seen in the screenshot below.

    <strong>Manual selection/association of PDB files with
      Sequences</strong>
  </p>
  <p>To manually associate PDB files with a sequence, select any of
    the follwing options listed below from the drop-down menu in the
    interface:
  <ul>
    <li><strong>From File</strong> - You can load a PDB file from
      the local machine or network and associate it with the selected
      sequence. PDB files associated in this way will also be saved in
      the <a href="jalarchive.html">Jalview Archive file</a>.<br></li>
    <li><strong>Enter PDB Id</strong> - Jalview will use the PDB
      Rest API, provided by the EBI, to fetch the PDB file with the
      entered Id.<br></li>
    <li><strong>Cached PDB Entries</strong> - You can view PDB
      structures which have previously been downloaded/viewed using this
      option. Jalview caches previously downloaded PDB entries in the
      computer memory. However, if the project is saved before exiting
      Jalview, Jalview will serialize the cached entries to the file
      system.</li>
  </ul>
