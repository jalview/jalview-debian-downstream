<p><strong>Sequence Feature Settings Dialog Box</strong></p>
<p>Select <strong>View&#8594;Feature Settings...</strong> menu entry
in an alignment window to open the feature settings dialog box, which
allows you to precisely control the presence and appearance of sequence
features for the current alignment.</p>

Sequence Feature Settings for the Jalview Application</img></center>
<p>The top section of the dialog box lists all the sequence feature
groups, along with a tickbox for each that controls whether its features
are displayed. The table in the middle lists all the features in the
currently selected groups, along with their display style and whether
they are currently being displayed (only the ticked features and groups
are displayed). <strong><em>You can change the colour or
shading style used for a feature in the associated alignment by clicking
on its colour box.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Feature settings pop-up menu</em></strong><br>
<strong>Right-click</strong> on a feature to open a pop-up menu that
allows you to sort the alignment or current selection using that feature
type (see below), or toggle the type of colouring used for the feature.
Features may be highlighted with either a single colour or a <a
	href="featureschemes.html">feature colourscheme</a> based on either the
scores associated with that feature or from the feature's description
(e.g. to distinguish different names associated with a DOMAIN feature).</p>
<p><strong>Ordering alignment by features</strong><br>
The 'Seq Sort by Score' and 'Seq Sort by Density' buttons will sort the
alignment based on the average score or total number of currently active
features and groups on each sequence. To order the alignment using a
specific feature type, use the <em>sort by ..</em> entries in the pop-up
menu for that type.<br>
<em>Feature sorting and graduated feature colouring was introduced
in jalview 2.5</em></p>

<p><strong>Transparency and Feature Ordering</strong></p>
<p>It is important to realise that sequence features are often not
distinct and often overlap (for example, a metal binding site feature
may be attached to one position along a stretch of sequence marked with
a secondary structure feature).</p>
<p>The ordering of the sequence features in the dialog box list is
the order used by jalview for rendering sequence features. A feature at
the bottom of the list is rendered <em>below</em> a feature higher up in
the list.<br>
<em><strong>You can change the order of a feature by
dragging it up and down the list with the mouse</strong></em>.</p>
<p>The <strong><em>Optimise order</em></strong> button (currently
only available in the application) will re-order the feature render
ordering based on the average length of each feature type.</p>
<p>The <strong><em>transparency slider setting</em></strong>
(currently only available in the application version) controls the
visibility of features rendered below other features. Reducing the
transparency will mean that features at the top of the list can obscure
features lower down, and increasing it allows the user to 'see through'
the upper layers of a set of features.</p>
<p><strong><em>You can save all features, with their
current colours and visibility in a Jalview format file. </em></strong></p>
