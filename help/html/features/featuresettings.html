    <strong>Sequence Feature Settings Dialog Box</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    Select <strong>View&#8594;Feature Settings...</strong> menu entry in
    an alignment window to open the feature settings dialog box, which
    allows you to precisely control the presence and appearance of
    sequence features for the current alignment.

  <p>
    The top section of the dialog box lists all the sequence feature
    groups, along with a tickbox for each that controls whether its
    features are displayed. The table in the middle lists all the
    features in the currently selected groups, along with their display
    style and whether they are currently being displayed (only the
    ticked features and groups are displayed). <strong><em>You
        can change the colour or shading style used for a feature in the
        associated alignment by clicking on its colour box.</em></strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    <a name="selectbyfeature"><strong><em>Selecting
          alignment columns by feature</em></strong></a><br> <strong>Double-clicking
      a feature type</strong> in the <strong>Feature Settings</strong> dialog
    allows you to select columns in the alignment that contain (or do
    not contain) features of that type. If a region of the alignment is
    currently selected, then only features in the current selection will
    be searched. The following keys affect the way in which selections
    are made:
  <ul>
    <li>Hold down <strong>Alt</strong> to select columns not
      containing features of a particular type.
    </li>
    <li>Hold down <strong>Shift</strong> to add columns to the
      current selection.
    </li>
    <li>Press <strong>Command/Windows key</strong> to toggle column
      selection state (XOR)
    </li>
  </ul>
  Options are also provided in the feature's pop-up menu (see below).
  <br />
  <em>Select columns by feature was added in Jalview 2.8.1</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong><em>Feature settings pop-up menu</em></strong><br> <strong>Right-click</strong>
    on a feature to open a pop-up menu that allows you to sort the
    alignment or current selection using that feature type (see below),
    or toggle the type of colouring used for the feature. Features may
    be highlighted with either a single colour or a <a
      href="featureschemes.html"
    >feature colourscheme</a> based on either the scores associated with
    that feature or from the feature's description (e.g. to distinguish
    different names associated with a DOMAIN feature).
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Ordering alignment by features</strong><br> The 'Seq
    Sort by Score' and 'Seq Sort by Density' buttons will sort the
    alignment based on the average score or total number of currently
    active features and groups on each sequence. To order the alignment
    using a specific feature type, use the <em>sort by ..</em> entries
    in the pop-up menu for that type.<br> <em>Feature sorting
      and graduated feature colouring were introduced in Jalview 2.5</em>
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Transparency and Feature Ordering</strong>
  </p>
  <p>It is important to realise that sequence features are often not
    distinct and often overlap (for example, a metal binding site
    feature may be attached to one position along a stretch of sequence
    marked with a secondary structure feature).</p>
  <p>
    The ordering of the sequence features in the dialog box list is the
    order used by Jalview for rendering sequence features. A feature at
    the bottom of the list is rendered <em>below</em> a feature higher
    up in the list.<br> <em><strong>You can change
        the order of a feature by dragging it up and down the list with
        the mouse</strong></em>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The <strong><em>Optimise order</em></strong> button (currently only
    available in the application) will re-order the feature render
    ordering based on the average length of each feature type.
  </p>
  <p>
    The <strong><em>transparency slider setting</em></strong> (currently
    only available in the application version) controls the visibility
    of features rendered below other features. Reducing the transparency
    will mean that features at the top of the list can obscure features
    lower down, and increasing it allows the user to 'see through' the
    upper layers of a set of features.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong><em>You can save all features, with their
        current colours and visibility in a Jalview format file. </em></strong>
