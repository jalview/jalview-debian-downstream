  <strong>The PDB Sequence Fetcher</strong>
  <p>
    Jalview provides a specialised interface that allows fast and
    efficient discovery and retrieval of data from the PDB database,
    based on the EMBL-EBI's PDBe BioSOLR query interface. It allows
    interactive querying of PDB metadata with free text and structured
    queries, so structures can be located without prior knowledge of
    their database accessions, or <em>via</em> manual cross-referencing
    with other bioinformatics websites.
  </p>
  <p>
    To open the PDB Sequence Fetcher, select PDB as the database from
    any <a href="seqfetch.html">Sequence Fetcher</a> dialog (opened <em>via</em>
    <strong>&quot;File &#8594;Fetch Sequences&quot;</strong>).

  <p>
    <strong>Searching the PDB Database</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    To search the PDB, begin typing in the text box. The results of your
    query are shown in the search results tab, which updates every time
    you type in the search text box. You can sort results according to
    the displayed columns, and select entries with the mouse and
    keyboard. Once you have selected one or more entries, hit the <strong>OK</strong>
    button to retrieve and view them in Jalview.
  </p>
  <p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Searching a specific PDB field</strong><br />If you
      want to find structures based on a specific PDB metadata field,
      you can select it from the drop-down menu.</li>
    <li><strong>Retrieving a unique chain for a PDB entry</strong><br>To
      retrieve a specific chain for a PDB entry, append the PDB ID with
      a colon followed by the chain code in the search box.<br /> e.g
      1xyz:A</li>

    <li><strong>Bulk PDB retrieval</strong><br>Multiple PDB
      IDs can be specified by separating them with a semi-colon.<br />
      e.g. 1xyz;2xyz;3xyz<br />Hitting Return or OK will automatically
      fetch those IDs, like the default Sequence Fetcher interface.</li>

    <li><strong>Wild card searching</strong><br>The following
      wild cards are supported by the EMBL-EBI PDBe query service:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>?</strong> matches a single character<br />The
          search string te?t would match both test and text.</li>
        <li><strong>*</strong> matches multiple characters<br />The
          search string: tes* - would match test, testing, and tester.</li>
      </ul> <em>Note:</em> you can use wildcard characters anywhere in a
      query string.<br />For example: te*t - would match test and text.
      *est - would match pest and test.</li>
    <li><strong>Structured queries</strong><br />The PDBe SOLR
      interface supports boolean query syntax, allowing quoted search
      strings to be combined with AND, OR, and NOT. Currently, no
      special support for constructing these queries is provided in the
      query dialog box.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    <strong>Customising The PDB Sequence Fetcher</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    To change the displayed meta-data in the search result, click the
    'Configure Displayed Columns' tab, and select the fields you'd like
    displayed. These fields can also be configured <em>via</em> the
    Structure tab of the <a href="preferences.html#structure">Jalview
      Desktop Preferences</a>.
