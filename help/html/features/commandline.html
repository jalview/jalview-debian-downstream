    <strong>Running Jalview from the command line</strong>
  </p>
  <p>Jalview is most easily run from the command line if you have
    built it from source, or via the 'Jalview' executable created from
    the InstallAnywhere Jalview installation. Both of these mechanisms
    allow true command line execution of Jalview - allowing you to
    provide additional options.</p>
  <p>The Java Webstart version of Jalview can be executed from the
    command line using something like :
  <pre>javaws http://www.jalview.org/webstart/jalview.jnlp -open
 <em>yourFileName</em>
  </pre>
  But, this is not guaranteed to work on all versions of webstart on all
  operating systems, and doesn't let you execute Jalview with any
  additional parameters.
  <p>
    <strong>Running Jalview from the InstallAnywhere
      installation</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    If you install with InstallAnywhere you can use several more
    commands. However, if you call the application with the link
    provided by InstallAnywhere any output from the application will be
    sent to output.txt, not standard out.<br> The Jalview
    application also requires a number of additional libraries on the
    class path. The command line below adds the Jalview installation's
    'lib' directory to the list of directories that are searched for
    jars to be added to the classpath:
  </p>
  <pre>java -Djava.ext.dirs=$INSTALL_DIR$/lib -cp $INSTALL_DIR$/jalview.jar jalview.bin.Jalview -open [FILE] </pre>
  <p>
    Use '-help' to get more information on the <a
      href="clarguments.html"
    >command line arguments</a> that Jalview accepts.
