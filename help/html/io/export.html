<p><strong>Exporting alignments as graphics and lineart<a name="export"></a></strong></p>
<p>The alignment view can be printed using
<strong>File&#8594;Print</strong>, or exported in a number of ways via the
<strong>File&#8594;Export</strong> menu:
<ul>
<li>HTML<br><em>for viewing in a web browser</em>
</li>
<li>PNG - a Portable Networks Graphics image<br><em>For low quality
diagrams and powerpoint presentations</em>
</li>
<li>EPS - an Encapsulated Postscript Document<br><em>For high quality
diagrams and publications.</em>
</li></ul>
  
<p><em>Tips for working with EPS Files</em></p>
<li>The EPS file generated by jalview contains vector graphics which are directly 
  editable in graphics applications such as Adobe Illustrator.</li>
<li>EPS files can be produced as &quot;Text&quot; or &quot;Lineart&quot;. Use 
  &quot;Text&quot; if you want the final document to be MUCH smaller in diskspace 
  and be able to search, edit and select text. Use &quot;Lineart&quot; if you 
  want an exact image of the alignment as displayed in Jalview. This is useful 
  if a 3rd Party EPS viewer does not have the same Font which the EPS file was 
  created with.</li>
<li>When importing an EPS into to a Microsoft office document, a snapshot image of the
  file will be displayed which often looks blurred. Right-click the
  image and choose &quot;Edit image.&quot; to convert it to word
  drawing objects which give a truer WYSIWIG representation.
  </li>
  <li>
  Mac OSX users will find that eps files are automatically converted into
  PDF files.
