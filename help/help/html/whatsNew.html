    <strong>Known Issues</strong>
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>We've had reports from a small number of windows 10 users
      who see a warning dialog pop up when Jalview tries to save a new
      version of an existing file. If you are affected by this bug and
      this latest version of Jalview doesn't fix it, please let us know!</li>
    <li>Co-located features exported and re-imported are ordered
      differently when shown on alignment and in tooltips. (Also affects
      v2.11.1.0)</li>
    <li>Drag and drop of alignment file onto alignment window when
      in a HiDPI scaled mode in Linux only works for the top left
      quadrant of the alignment window.</li>
  </ul>
