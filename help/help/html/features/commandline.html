    <strong>Running Jalview from the command line</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    Jalview can be run from the command line, and provides a <a
      href="clarguments.html">range of arguments</a>. These arguments
    can also be passed via <strong>.JVL</strong> files, which are opened
    automatically by the Jalview application when double-clicked in a
    file browser on Windows and OSX.
  </p>
  The way that you launch Jalview from the command line depends on the
  platform you are on, and how it has been installed.

  <ul>
    <li>Standard installation on Linux/Unix:<pre>
       /PATH_TO_JALVIEW/Jalview -open https://www.jalview.org/examples/jpred_msa.fasta -annotations https://www.jalview.org/examples/jpred_msa.seq.concise -colour Clustal</pre>
    </li>
    <li>Standard installation on Windows:<pre>
      \PATH_TO_JALVIEW\Jalview.exe -open %HOMEPATH%\myalignment.fa</pre>
    </li>
    <li>OSX Application:<pre>
open /Applications/Jalview.app --args -open ~/myalignment.fa</pre><em>(put
        all the Jalview arguments <em>after</em> the --args parameter)
    </em><br />
    <br /></li>
    <li>Jalview standalone executable Jar<pre>
        &lt;Path to Java home&gt;/bin/java -jar &lt;Path to Jalview Jar&gt;/jalview-all-1.8.jar -open myalignment.fa</pre></li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    If you have installed Jalview via <em>conda</em> or another package
    manager then you most likely have a 'jalview' command available in
    your terminal shell's default path. Alternately, if you have built
    Jalview from source, then take a look at the doc/building.md file
    included in the source distribution.
  </p>
  <p>
    Use '-help' to get more information on the <a
      href="clarguments.html">command line arguments</a> that Jalview
    accepts.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Passing JVM Arguments to Jalview</strong><br /> If you need
    to modify parameters for Jalview's Java Virtual Machine, or
    configure system properties, then take a look at the instructions
    for how to <a href="../memory.html#jvm">setting the JVM's
      maximum memory</a>.<br /> 
  <p>
    <strong>Changing Jalview's 'Look and Feel'</strong> <br />If you
    are experiencing issues with the font size or layout of Jalview's
    GUI, you can try changing Jalview's 'Look and feel' by
    specifying a custom system property 'laf' on startup (see <a
      href="../memory.html#jvm">setting the JVM's memory</a> for
    instructions on how to do this for your platform). <br />For the
    Jalview standalone executable jar, simply provide one of the
    property settings before the -jar argument
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>-Dlaf=system (default look and feel for the OS)</li>
    <li>-Dlaf=crossplatform (Java's Metal Look and Feel)</li>
    <li>-Dlaf=nimbus (Java's alternative Nimbus Look and Feel)</li>
    <li>-Dlaf=mac (only has an effect on OSX)</li>
    <li>-Dlaf=gtk (only has an effect on Linux)</li>
  </ul>
  The currently configured look and feel is logged to Jalview's console.
  Once the look and feel has been changed, it will be stored in
  Jalview's .jalview_properties file for future Jalview sessions.
