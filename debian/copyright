Upstream-Name: jalview
Upstream-Contact: jalview-discuss@jalview.org
Source:
  The original tarball was made downloading the jalview-*.tar.gz
  tarball on http://www.jalview.org/versions.html, and stripping most
  of the binary-only jars excepted lib/vamsas-client.jar.
  . 
  For more details, see the debian/new-upstream script that does precisely
  this.
Disclaimer:
  The tarball contains a sourceless binary jar, 
  lib/vamsas-client.jar. Though the distribution and use of this file
  is allowed by its copyright holders, the absence of source prevents
  it from being integrated into Debian main.
