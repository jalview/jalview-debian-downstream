jalview (2.7.dfsg~almost-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial release (Closes: #507436)
  * Adding a debian/new-upstream script to repackage the original tarball,
    getting rid of the bundled precompiled JAR files (I love JAR files)
    (well, almost, which is why this goes in non-free for now)
  * Using dh 7 and javahelper
  * Using jh_build for building
