jalview (2.7.dfsg-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Upload to unstable now that jmol is there too
  * Pull patches/newer-jmol-api.diff from upstream's git repository to
    make jalview work with jmol currently in unstable.

jalview (2.7.dfsg-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * Initial release (Closes: #507436)
  * Adding a debian/new-upstream script to repackage the original tarball,
    getting rid of the bundled precompiled JAR files (I love JAR files)
  * Using dh 7 and javahelper
  * Using jh_build for building
  * Uploading to experimental as it works only with the version of jmol in
    experimental
